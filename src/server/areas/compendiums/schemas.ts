/**
 * Input schemas of the compendium tools.
 *
 * The contract is kept exactly as the previous generation offered it:
 * parameter names, types, enums, required parameters, defaults and the shape
 * of the range objects. tools.test.ts compares that shape. The descriptions
 * are written anew for this rewrite, in the words of its behaviour: whole
 * names instead of substrings, the default limit of the creature search, no
 * dashes. The schemas are put together from the small builders below, so each
 * parameter reads as one line: name, kind, description.
 *
 * The Pathfinder 2e and Cosmere parameters stay. Their adapters come back
 * (decision of 13.09.2026); until then the module reports them as ignored.
